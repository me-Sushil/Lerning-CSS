Introduction
In this chapter, you'll learn how to position any HTML element on a webpage using CSS.

The position property is used to precisely control where elements appear on a page, helping 
you make a pixel-perfect layout.

By default, this property is set to static. To use this property, you'll have to set it to 
one of the following values:

relative
absolute
fixed
sticky
Let's learn about these values one by one.





Position: Relative
We use position: relative; to move an element by a certain number of pixels from its original 
position.

Consider the following bell icon:

Before Positioning
Let's see how you can move it using relative position:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}

.icon {
    font-size: 36px;

    /* Enables top/left positioning */
    position: relative;

    /* Moves the icon 25px away from both 
    the top and the left of original position */
    left: 25px;
    top: 25px;
}


After Position relative
Using relative positioning, we've shifted the icon to center it within the <div> element.


Note: Removing position: relative; from your code will restore the icon to its original 
position. This means you can use the top, right, bottom, or left properties only after you
assign a position value to the required element.









Position: Absolute
Here's how the badge looks initially:

Example: Absolute
Figure: Example: Absolute
Let's position the badge to the top-right corner of .notifications:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;

    /* Sets notifications as reference parent */
    position: relative;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    /* Positions the badge absolute to the reference parent */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
}


Example: Absolute
Figure: Position: Absolute
This positions the badge to the top right corner of the notifications <div>.

Try tweaking the values of top and right to get it positioned perfectly like this.

Example: Absolute
Figure: Example: Absolute
Once you've finished experimenting, continue reading below.

The following values for top and right can help you achieve the placement as seen in the image:

.badge {
    position: absolute; 
    top: -10px;
    right: -15px;
}
Paste this code section to position the badge.


Note: In CSS, an element with position: absolute looks for a reference parent to determine
 its position on the page. A reference parent is any element that has position: relative 
 or position: absolute.











 Omitting Position: Relative
If you forget to position the parent, the browser window becomes the reference parent.

index.html
<div class="notifications">
    <span class="icon">🔔</span>
    <span class="badge">30</span>
</div>

style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    /* Sets the window as reference parent */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
}


Window as Reference
Figure: Omitting Position: Relative
This positions the badge to the top right corner of the window.










Why Shouldn't You Use Position: Relative?
You might think this could be achieved using only position: relative too.

Let's see what issue this might create:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    position: relative;
    top: -60px;
    right: -45px;
}


Position Relative
Figure: Why Shouldn't You Use Position: Relative?
When using position: relative, the element remains in its original place in the document flow. 
It is only visually shifted by the specified amount.

However, position: absolute completely removes the element from the document flow. That's why 
the unwanted spacing, as seen in the image, doesn't exist when done so.


Note: Relative positioning simply moves the element visually, while absolute positioning takes 
the element out of the flow entirely, allowing other elements to occupy its original space.





Position: Fixed
The third positioning value is fixed, which makes an element stay at the same spot on the screen, 
even when you've scrolled the page.

Take a look at the navigation bar on the Programiz Pro homepage. It always remains fixed at the top,
 no matter how far down the page is scrolled.

Let's create a similar fixed navbar:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    /* Makes the navbar fixed at 0px from top */
    position: fixed; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    /* Sets the height to twice the browser's height */
    height: 200vh;
}
Try scrolling down and notice the position of the navbar. It remains fixed.

But, positioning an element as fixed causes an issue. Compare the HTML code to our output, 
and try to spot this issue.

Did you see it? The first two paragraphs in content aren't visible anymore.

Let's learn how to fix this.



Position: Fixed
Setting the navbar to fixed removes it from the document flow and renders it on top. This hide 
the paragraphs below.

To fix this issue, we can add a margin-top to the content class that is equal to the height of
 the navbar:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    position: fixed; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    height: 200vh;

    /* Adding margin to compensate for navbar's height */
    margin-top: 70px;
}
Adding a margin value now makes the content below visible.








Position: Sticky
Applying position: fixed on an element removes it from the document flow and requires compensating
 for it using margin-top.

With the fourth positioning value, position: sticky, this issue is handled automatically.

With sticky, the element behaves like a regular element in the document flow. When scrolled past,
it becomes "stuck" to a specified position.

Let's change the position in the earlier example from fixed to sticky:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    position: sticky; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    height: 200vh;
}
Try scrolling down this page.

The navbar now takes its original space in the document flow and solves the earlier issue.







Position: Sticky
There's another neat thing you can do with position sticky—you can make an element stick 
only as long as its parent is in view.

Example

index.html
<body>
    <div class="main">
        <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
    </div>
</body>

style.css
body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 200vh;
}

.main {
    background-color: #eee; 
    height: 100vh;
    padding: 10px;
}

.sidebar {
    background: black; 
    color: white;
    width: 70px;
    height: 150px;
    padding: 20px;
  
    position: sticky;
    top: 0; 
}
The sidebar element sticks to the top only as long as its parent (the main section) lasts. 
As soon as the main section ends, the sidebar doesn't stick anymore.

Takeaway: With position: sticky, the sidebar stays stuck as long as its parent element is in view. 
Once the parent scrolls out of view, the sidebar stops sticking.








Z-Index
You've learned the four main values for the position property: relative, absolute, fixed and sticky.
 Great job!

Now, you'll learn about the z-index property.

The z-index property controls the stacking of positioned elements.

It allows you to change whether the element is stacked in front of or behind another element on the
 screen.

Let's see an example where this can be useful.




Example: Z-Index
Consider the code below:

index.html
<div class="box1">Box1</div>
<div class="box2">Box2</div>

style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 100px;
    background: #aaa;
    position: absolute;
}

.box2 {
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    background: #ddd;
}


Z-index Example
Figure: Example: Z-Index
Here, box1 is positioned as absolute.

As a result, it is removed from the document flow and rendered in front.

Next, let's see how you can make box2 appear before box1 using the z-index property.






Example: Making box2 Appear Before box1
To make box2 appear before box1, you need to make box2 a positioned element.

After that, assign a higher z-index value to box2 and a lower z-index value to box1.

index.html
style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 100px;
    background: #aaa;
    position: absolute;
  
    z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    background: #ddd;

    /* Making box2 a positioned element. 
    Any position value works (except static) */
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
}


Z-Index Example
Figure: Example: Making box2 Appear Before box1
Here, we first made both box1 and box2 positioned elements. Then, we set the z-index of box1 
to 1 and box2 to 2.

Elements with lower z-index value are rendered first. Then, those with higher z-index are stacked 
in front.

So, box1 is rendered first, and box2 is stacked in front of it.

Idea Emoji
Note: z-index works only on positioned elements.




Quiz: You set z-index: 10 on an element, but it doesn't appear on top of other overlapping elements.
 What could be the issue?

 Correct Answer!
B:
The element doesn't have a position value (like relative, absolute, or fixed) set in its CSS.
The z-index only works when the element is positioned, meaning it must have a position value other than static.


Quiz: You created a position: fixed navigation bar, but when you view it on a long scrolling page, the bar disappears under other elements. What is most likely the problem?

Correct Answer!
A:
You didn't give the navigation bar a high enough z-index to stay above other elements.
Without a high enough z-index, your fixed element can be covered by other overlapping content.
