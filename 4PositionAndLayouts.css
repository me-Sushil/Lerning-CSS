Introduction
In this chapter, you'll learn how to position any HTML element on a webpage using CSS.

The position property is used to precisely control where elements appear on a page, helping 
you make a pixel-perfect layout.

By default, this property is set to static. To use this property, you'll have to set it to 
one of the following values:

relative
absolute
fixed
sticky
Let's learn about these values one by one.





Position: Relative
We use position: relative; to move an element by a certain number of pixels from its original 
position.

Consider the following bell icon:

Before Positioning
Let's see how you can move it using relative position:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}

.icon {
    font-size: 36px;

    /* Enables top/left positioning */
    position: relative;

    /* Moves the icon 25px away from both 
    the top and the left of original position */
    left: 25px;
    top: 25px;
}


After Position relative
Using relative positioning, we've shifted the icon to center it within the <div> element.


Note: Removing position: relative; from your code will restore the icon to its original 
position. This means you can use the top, right, bottom, or left properties only after you
assign a position value to the required element.









Position: Absolute
Here's how the badge looks initially:

Example: Absolute
Figure: Example: Absolute
Let's position the badge to the top-right corner of .notifications:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;

    /* Sets notifications as reference parent */
    position: relative;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    /* Positions the badge absolute to the reference parent */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
}


Example: Absolute
Figure: Position: Absolute
This positions the badge to the top right corner of the notifications <div>.

Try tweaking the values of top and right to get it positioned perfectly like this.

Example: Absolute
Figure: Example: Absolute
Once you've finished experimenting, continue reading below.

The following values for top and right can help you achieve the placement as seen in the image:

.badge {
    position: absolute; 
    top: -10px;
    right: -15px;
}
Paste this code section to position the badge.


Note: In CSS, an element with position: absolute looks for a reference parent to determine
 its position on the page. A reference parent is any element that has position: relative 
 or position: absolute.











 Omitting Position: Relative
If you forget to position the parent, the browser window becomes the reference parent.

index.html
<div class="notifications">
    <span class="icon">🔔</span>
    <span class="badge">30</span>
</div>

style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    /* Sets the window as reference parent */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
}


Window as Reference
Figure: Omitting Position: Relative
This positions the badge to the top right corner of the window.










Why Shouldn't You Use Position: Relative?
You might think this could be achieved using only position: relative too.

Let's see what issue this might create:

index.html
style.css
.notifications {
    background: #ddd;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 50px;
    padding: 30px;
    font-size: 36px;
}

.badge {
    font-size: 24px;
    line-height: 16px;

    position: relative;
    top: -60px;
    right: -45px;
}


Position Relative
Figure: Why Shouldn't You Use Position: Relative?
When using position: relative, the element remains in its original place in the document flow. 
It is only visually shifted by the specified amount.

However, position: absolute completely removes the element from the document flow. That's why 
the unwanted spacing, as seen in the image, doesn't exist when done so.


Note: Relative positioning simply moves the element visually, while absolute positioning takes 
the element out of the flow entirely, allowing other elements to occupy its original space.





Position: Fixed
The third positioning value is fixed, which makes an element stay at the same spot on the screen, 
even when you've scrolled the page.

Take a look at the navigation bar on the Programiz Pro homepage. It always remains fixed at the top,
 no matter how far down the page is scrolled.

Let's create a similar fixed navbar:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    /* Makes the navbar fixed at 0px from top */
    position: fixed; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    /* Sets the height to twice the browser's height */
    height: 200vh;
}
Try scrolling down and notice the position of the navbar. It remains fixed.

But, positioning an element as fixed causes an issue. Compare the HTML code to our output, 
and try to spot this issue.

Did you see it? The first two paragraphs in content aren't visible anymore.

Let's learn how to fix this.



Position: Fixed
Setting the navbar to fixed removes it from the document flow and renders it on top. This hide 
the paragraphs below.

To fix this issue, we can add a margin-top to the content class that is equal to the height of
 the navbar:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    position: fixed; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    height: 200vh;

    /* Adding margin to compensate for navbar's height */
    margin-top: 70px;
}
Adding a margin value now makes the content below visible.








Position: Sticky
Applying position: fixed on an element removes it from the document flow and requires compensating
 for it using margin-top.

With the fourth positioning value, position: sticky, this issue is handled automatically.

With sticky, the element behaves like a regular element in the document flow. When scrolled past,
it becomes "stuck" to a specified position.

Let's change the position in the earlier example from fixed to sticky:

index.html
<div class="navbar">
    <div id="logo">Programiz</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <p>Scroll down to see the navbar stay fixed at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>More content here...</p>
    <p>Keep scrolling...</p>
</div>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
}

.navbar {
    width: 100%; 
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 20px; 

    position: sticky; 
    top: 0px;
}

.content {
    height: 200vh;
}
Try scrolling down this page.

The navbar now takes its original space in the document flow and solves the earlier issue.







Position: Sticky
There's another neat thing you can do with position sticky—you can make an element stick 
only as long as its parent is in view.

Example

index.html
<body>
    <div class="main">
        <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
    </div>
</body>

style.css
body {
    margin: 0;
    height: 200vh;
}

.main {
    background-color: #eee; 
    height: 100vh;
    padding: 10px;
}

.sidebar {
    background: black; 
    color: white;
    width: 70px;
    height: 150px;
    padding: 20px;
  
    position: sticky;
    top: 0; 
}
The sidebar element sticks to the top only as long as its parent (the main section) lasts. 
As soon as the main section ends, the sidebar doesn't stick anymore.

Takeaway: With position: sticky, the sidebar stays stuck as long as its parent element is in view. 
Once the parent scrolls out of view, the sidebar stops sticking.








Z-Index
You've learned the four main values for the position property: relative, absolute, fixed and sticky.
 Great job!

Now, you'll learn about the z-index property.

The z-index property controls the stacking of positioned elements.

It allows you to change whether the element is stacked in front of or behind another element on the
 screen.

Let's see an example where this can be useful.




Example: Z-Index
Consider the code below:

index.html
<div class="box1">Box1</div>
<div class="box2">Box2</div>

style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 100px;
    background: #aaa;
    position: absolute;
}

.box2 {
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    background: #ddd;
}


Z-index Example
Figure: Example: Z-Index
Here, box1 is positioned as absolute.

As a result, it is removed from the document flow and rendered in front.

Next, let's see how you can make box2 appear before box1 using the z-index property.






Example: Making box2 Appear Before box1
To make box2 appear before box1, you need to make box2 a positioned element.

After that, assign a higher z-index value to box2 and a lower z-index value to box1.

index.html
style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 100px;
    background: #aaa;
    position: absolute;
  
    z-index: 1;
}

.box2 {
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    background: #ddd;

    /* Making box2 a positioned element. 
    Any position value works (except static) */
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
}


Z-Index Example
Figure: Example: Making box2 Appear Before box1
Here, we first made both box1 and box2 positioned elements. Then, we set the z-index of box1 
to 1 and box2 to 2.

Elements with lower z-index value are rendered first. Then, those with higher z-index are stacked 
in front.

So, box1 is rendered first, and box2 is stacked in front of it.

Idea Emoji
Note: z-index works only on positioned elements.




Quiz: You set z-index: 10 on an element, but it doesn't appear on top of other overlapping elements.
 What could be the issue?

 Correct Answer!
B:
The element doesn't have a position value (like relative, absolute, or fixed) set in its CSS.
The z-index only works when the element is positioned, meaning it must have a position value other than static.


Quiz: You created a position: fixed navigation bar, but when you view it on a long scrolling page, the bar disappears under other elements. What is most likely the problem?

Correct Answer!
A:
You didn't give the navigation bar a high enough z-index to stay above other elements.
Without a high enough z-index, your fixed element can be covered by other overlapping content.








Float and Clear



Introduction
The float property allows you to push an element to the left or right and lets the rest of the 
content flow around it.

This technique was commonly used for creating two-column layouts, where elements are placed side
 by side.


Note: Float is considered an older method and has largely been replaced by more modern layout 
systems like Flexbox and Grid, which we'll explore in upcoming chapters.
This chapter covers the basics of float and clear, providing just enough information to understand 
and work with legacy code. Let's start with some examples.





Float Values
The float property has two main values: left and right. These values determine where the element 
is "floated" within its container, allowing other content to flow around it.

Consider the example below:

index.html
<div class="box"></div>
<p class="content">This is some sample text.</p>


style.css
.box {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #ddd;
}

Float Example
Figure: Float Values
In this example, we have a <div> with the class box and a paragraph of text.

If we set float: left on the box, the element will move to the left, and the text will flow to 
its right, occupying the remaining space.

You'll see how this works next.





Float Left
Let's modify our previous code to make the box float to the left.

index.html
style.css
.box {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #ddd;

    float: left;
}



Float Left  Example
Figure: Float Left
With float: left, the box is positioned to the left, and the content wraps around it on the right.
 The content doesn't overlap but flows neatly beside the floated element.




Float Right
Now, change the box class to float: right and observe the difference.

index.html
style.css
.box {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #ddd;

    float: right;
}
Run the code and observe the output.

By using float: right, the box is pushed to the right, and the text flows around it on the left.
 The content behaves similarly but adapts to the new float position.






 Float for Two-Column Layouts
In the past, floats were commonly used to create multi-column layouts because they allow elements
 to sit side by side.

Below is a section from the Programiz Pro website. You can build a two-column design like this 
using floats.

Float Website Example
Figure: Float Website Example
Let's implement a basic two-column layout using floats:

index.html
<div class="box1">Box 1</div>
<div class="box2">Box 2</div>
<p>Some example text that flows beneath the boxes and demonstrates the float behavior.</p>

style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #ddd;

    float: left;
}

.box2 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #aaa;

    float: right;
}



Float Two-Column Example
Figure: Float for Two-Column Layouts
In this example, the first box (.box1) floats to the left, and the second box (.box2) floats 
to the right.

This creates a simple two-column layout, with the two boxes appearing side by side, and the text
 below them should flow naturally underneath. However, it doesn't.

Elements that follow floated content often need to be manually cleared to prevent overlapping or
 misalignment.

To fix this, you can clear the float on the element immediately after the floated elements (in 
this case, the <p> tag). Let's see how we can achieve this.







Clearfix Hack
You can fix the floating problem using a neat hack called the clearfix hack. This approach prevents
 layout issues caused by floats.

To do this, you wrap the elements in a new <div>. Assign the class clearfix to the new <div> 
and add the following code in CSS:

.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
 

Note: While the class is commonly named "clearfix" due to the popularity of this solution, you 
can name it anything. Just make sure the CSS rule applies to the same class you assign to the 
container.
index.html
<div class="clearfix">
    <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
    <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
</div>

<p>Some example text that flows beneath the boxes and demonstrates the float behavior.</p>

style.css
.box1 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #ddd;

    float: left;
}

.box2 {
    height: 200px;
    width: 300px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    background: #aaa;

    float: right;
}
.clearfix::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}


Clear fix Example

Note: Don't worry if this feels a bit advanced; you don't need to understand it immediately.

Project: Positioning and Layout





Create a Navbar
In this chapter, we learned about the position, z-index, and float properties in CSS. Let's create a navbar using our understanding of these properties.

This is what our final navbar will look like:

index.html
<body>
    <nav class="navbar">
        <div class="logo">GreatBrand</div>
        <div class="navbar-items">
            <div class="navbar-item">About</div>
            <div class="navbar-item offer">
                Special Offers
                <span class="offer-badge">New!</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <p>This is a sample navbar.</p>
    </main>
</body>

style.css
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
}

body {
    height: 200vh;
}

.navbar {
    background: #111;
    height: 70px;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}

.navbar-item {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 4px 10px;
}

.logo {
    font-size: 20px;
    float: left;
}

.navbar-items {
    float: right;
}

.offer {
    position: relative;
}

.offer-badge {
    background-color: red;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 5px 8px;
    font-size: 12px;
    position: absolute;
    top: -20px;
    right: -25px;
}
Let's begin.



Step 1: Basic Structure
Let's start with HTML and some basic CSS.

We'll create a simple navbar containing a logo and two navigation items, including a special
 offers section. This is our starting point.

index.html
<body>
    <nav class="navbar">
        <div class="logo">GreatBrand</div>
        <div class="navbar-items">
            <div class="navbar-item">About</div>
            <div class="navbar-item offer">
                Special Offers
                <span class="offer-badge">New!</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <p>This is a sample navbar.</p>
    </main>
</body>

style.css
/* Reset browser styles */
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
}

body {
    height: 200vh;
}



Step 2: Positioning the Navbar
Now, let's add these basic CSS to style our navbar:

Set the background color and height of the navbar.
Change the navbar's position to sticky so it stays at the top when we scroll.
Set the color of the text.
index.html
style.css
.navbar {
    color: white;
    background: #111111;
    height: 70px;

    /* Sticky position added */
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
}





Step 3: Logo Positioning
Next, let's focus on positioning the logo with these CSS:

Change the logo's font size and float it to the left.
Apply some padding to center the nav items.
index.html
style.css
.navbar {
    color: white;
    background: #111111;
    height: 70px;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;

    /* Padding added */
    padding: 20px;
}

.logo {
    font-size: 20px;

    /* Logo floated left */
    float: left;
}





Step 4: Aligning Navbar Items
Now, we'll work on the navigation items with these steps:

Float the items in the navbar-items container to the right.
Space the items using margin.
index.html
style.css
.navbar-item {
    /* Stop line breaks between items */
    display: inline-block;

    /* Margin added */
    margin: 4px 10px;
}

.navbar-items {
    /* Nav items floated right */
    float: right;
}









Step 5: Highlighting Special Offers
Finally, let's style the "Special Offers" navigation item using relative positioning. 
This will allow us to position the badge relative to this item, making it stand out.

index.html
style.css
.offer {
    /* Positioning parent */
    position: relative;
}

.offer-badge {
    background-color: red;
    border-radius: 15px;
    padding: 5px 8px;
    font-size: 12px;

    /* Positioning badge */
    position: absolute;
    top: -20px;
    right: -25px;
}
Let's see how this navbar will look like in a full-fledged webpage.















Final Results
And that's how you can make a navbar using CSS!

Our navbar features a logo, navigation items, and a special offers badge.

It stays fixed at the top of the viewport as we scroll through the page. Here's the complete code:

index.html
<body>
    <nav class="navbar">
        <div class="logo">GreatBrand</div>
        <div class="navbar-items">
            <div class="navbar-item">About</div>
            <div class="navbar-item offer">
                Special Offers
                <span class="offer-badge">New!</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </nav>

    <main>
        <section class="hero">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>Welcome to GreatBrand</h1>
                <p>Discover amazing products and unbeatable offers</p>
                <button class="cta-button">
                    Get Started
                    <span class="chevron-right">❯</span>
                </button>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="features">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Our Features</h2>
                <div class="feature-list">
