Pseudo-Selectors




Introduction
In this chapter, you'll learn how to apply CSS to HTML elements, specifically tables, lists, and
 forms.

Before styling these elements, you must be familiar with their structure in HTML. If you need a 
refresher, revisit the basics of tables, lists, and forms.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to style these elements effectively, making your
 content visually appealing and easier to use.

To do this, you need to understand an essential concept in CSS: pseudo-selectors.

Let's get started.








Pseudo-Classes
Pseudo-classes style specific states or positions of elements. They are preceded by a :.

For example, you can style a button only when it's hovered (state) using the pseudo-class :hover.

index.html
<a href="#">This is an important message.</a>

style.css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}


Pseudo-Selectors
The red color is applied only when the user hovers over the element.





Commonly Used Pseudo-Classes
Let's look at some commonly used pseudo-classes:

Pseudo-Class	Description
:hover	        Styles an element when a user hovers over it.
:first-child	Styles the first child element of a parent.
:nth-child(n)	Styles the nth child element of a parent.






Example: The :first-child Pseudo-Class
The first-child pseudo-class selector styles the first child of its parent element. For example:

index.html
<div>
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph.</p>
</div>

style.css
div p:first-child {
    color: red;
}


first-child Pseudo-class Selector
The above code colors only the first paragraph element (the first child of the <div> element) to red.






Example: The :nth-child Pseudo-Class
The :nth-child pseudo-class selector styles a specific child of its parent element based on its 
position.

For example:

index.html
<div>
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph.</p>
    <p>Third paragraph.</p>
</div>

style.css
div p:nth-child(2) {
    color: blue;
}


:nth-child Pseudo-class Selector
Here, the div p:nth-child(2) selector:

Targets the second <p> element inside the <div> (since it's the second child of the <div> element).
Changes the color of the selected <p> element to blue.











Advanced Use of :nth-child Pseudo-Class Selector
The :nth-child selector can do more than just target a specific child. It can also handle patterns
 like odd and even.

You can use :nth-child(odd) to target all odd-numbered elements and :nth-child(even) to target all
 even-numbered elements.

Example

index.html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>

style.css
ul li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: lightgray;
}

ul li:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: gray;
}


Alternating list items styled with nth-child
In this example,

ul li:nth-child(odd) applies a light gray background to all odd-numbered items
ul li:nth-child(even) applies a gray background to all even-numbered list items.





Example: Using Formulas
The :nth-child selector can also accept formulas, like 3n or 2n+1, to create more complex patterns.

Example

index.html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 5</li>
    <li>Item 6</li>
    <li>Item 7</li>
    <li>Item 8</li>
    <li>Item 9</li>
</ul>

style.css
ul li:nth-child(3n) {
    color: red;
}


nth-child Pseudo-class with Formula
This selector will target every third item in the list, making it red. Formulas give you great
 flexibility in how you style your content.





 PROBLEM 
 Selecting and Styling the Second Child
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set the background color of the second <div> element to #8e44ad using the :nth-child pseudo-class.


SOLUTION
div:nth-child(2) {
    background-color:#8e44ad;
}






Pseudo-Element Selectors
Pseudo-elements let you style certain portions of text or add content before or after an 
element without modifying the HTML.

They are preceded by double colons (::).

Example

index.html
<p>This is an important message.</p>

style.css
/* Add content before a paragraph */
p::before {
    content: "Note: ";
    font-weight: bold;
    color: red;
}

/* Style the first letter of a paragraph */
p::first-letter {
    font-size: 2em;
    color: blue;
}


Pseudo-Element Selectors
Here, the text "Note: " is added before the paragraph, and the first letter of the paragraph 
is styled separately.







Tables


Introduction
Tables are a great way to organize and present data in a structured format. Let's look at an example:

index.html
<table>
    <caption>Table Caption</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Harry Depp</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>Britain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John Smith</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ram Krishna</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>Nepal</td>
    </tr>
</table>
Try running this code. The table appears, but it looks plain and unstructured.

HTML Table
Let's add some CSS properties to make it look better.





Table Borders
First, let's add a border to the table to give it a more defined structure.

You can use the border property for this task. For example:

index.html
<table>
    <caption>Table Caption</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Harry Depp</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>Britain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John Smith</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ram Krishna</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>Nepal</td>
    </tr>
</table>

style.css
table {
    border: 1px solid black;
}


HTML Table with Border
Now, the table has a black border, making it more structured. But you'll notice the rows
 and columns inside the table still lack borders.




 Adding Borders to Rows and Columns
To add borders to both the rows and columns, you need to apply the border to the table header 
(th) and table data (td) cells.

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
Now, the table has black borders around the cells, making the structure more defined.

HTML Table with Border and Cell Border
Figure: Adding Borders to Rows and Columns
However, the content looks cramped. Next, you'll remove this double border in the table to make 
the content less cramped and more readable.





Border Collapse
If you look closely, you can see a gap between the table borders in the previous example.

You can remove this gap by collapsing the borders using the border-collapse property.

Example

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse; /* Collapses table borders */
}
Now the table looks much smoother.

HTML Table with Collapsed Border
Now, let's center the text inside each table cell both horizontally and vertically.









Table Alignment
Alignment is crucial for creating a reader-friendly table. Use the following properties to 
handle the alignment of the text inside your table:

text-align - Determines the horizontal alignment.
vertical-align - Determines the vertical alignment.
Example

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center; /* Centers text horizontally */
    vertical-align: middle; /* Centers text vertically */
    border-collapse: collapse; 
}
The texts inside the table cells are now aligned to the center—horizontally and vertically. 
The addition of 10px padding also enhances the neatness of the cells.

HTML Table with Center Alignment
However, you might not always want to align table content to the center. Don't worry; CSS has 
other alignment values as well.

Let's explore them next.






Table Alignment Values
The image below shows the different values you can use to align the content of your cells, 
along with how those values will place the text within the cell:

HTML Table Alignments
Figure: Some of the Possible Table Alignments
The first table shows examples of different text-align values applied to table cells (left, 
right, center, justify).

Similarly, the second table shows examples of different vertical-align values (top, middle, 
bottom, baseline).






Example: HTML Table Styling
We will create a table style with a modern touch that has striped rows and hover effects.

With just a few lines of CSS, you can transform a plain HTML table into something visually 
appealing and interactive.

index.html
<table class="striped-hover-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
         <th>Occupation</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>John Doe</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>Software Engineer</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Jane Smith</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>Graphic Designer</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Sam Wilson</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>Project Manager</td>
    </tr>
</table>

style.css
.striped-hover-table {
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

.striped-hover-table th, .striped-hover-table td {
    padding: 12px;
    text-align: left;
}

.striped-hover-table tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

.striped-hover-table tr:hover {
    background-color: #e9e9e9;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.striped-hover-table th {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
}


HTML Table Styling
This example shows how CSS can make your tables look modern and engaging.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating attractive tables, you can create virtually
 any design you can imagine.
