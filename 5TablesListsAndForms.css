Pseudo-Selectors




Introduction
In this chapter, you'll learn how to apply CSS to HTML elements, specifically tables, lists, and
 forms.

Before styling these elements, you must be familiar with their structure in HTML. If you need a 
refresher, revisit the basics of tables, lists, and forms.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to style these elements effectively, making your
 content visually appealing and easier to use.

To do this, you need to understand an essential concept in CSS: pseudo-selectors.

Let's get started.








Pseudo-Classes
Pseudo-classes style specific states or positions of elements. They are preceded by a :.

For example, you can style a button only when it's hovered (state) using the pseudo-class :hover.

index.html
<a href="#">This is an important message.</a>

style.css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}


Pseudo-Selectors
The red color is applied only when the user hovers over the element.





Commonly Used Pseudo-Classes
Let's look at some commonly used pseudo-classes:

Pseudo-Class	Description
:hover	        Styles an element when a user hovers over it.
:first-child	Styles the first child element of a parent.
:nth-child(n)	Styles the nth child element of a parent.






Example: The :first-child Pseudo-Class
The first-child pseudo-class selector styles the first child of its parent element. For example:

index.html
<div>
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph.</p>
</div>

style.css
div p:first-child {
    color: red;
}


first-child Pseudo-class Selector
The above code colors only the first paragraph element (the first child of the <div> element) to red.






Example: The :nth-child Pseudo-Class
The :nth-child pseudo-class selector styles a specific child of its parent element based on its 
position.

For example:

index.html
<div>
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph.</p>
    <p>Third paragraph.</p>
</div>

style.css
div p:nth-child(2) {
    color: blue;
}


:nth-child Pseudo-class Selector
Here, the div p:nth-child(2) selector:

Targets the second <p> element inside the <div> (since it's the second child of the <div> element).
Changes the color of the selected <p> element to blue.











Advanced Use of :nth-child Pseudo-Class Selector
The :nth-child selector can do more than just target a specific child. It can also handle patterns
 like odd and even.

You can use :nth-child(odd) to target all odd-numbered elements and :nth-child(even) to target all
 even-numbered elements.

Example

index.html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
</ul>

style.css
ul li:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: lightgray;
}

ul li:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: gray;
}


Alternating list items styled with nth-child
In this example,

ul li:nth-child(odd) applies a light gray background to all odd-numbered items
ul li:nth-child(even) applies a gray background to all even-numbered list items.





Example: Using Formulas
The :nth-child selector can also accept formulas, like 3n or 2n+1, to create more complex patterns.

Example

index.html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 5</li>
    <li>Item 6</li>
    <li>Item 7</li>
    <li>Item 8</li>
    <li>Item 9</li>
</ul>

style.css
ul li:nth-child(3n) {
    color: red;
}


nth-child Pseudo-class with Formula
This selector will target every third item in the list, making it red. Formulas give you great
 flexibility in how you style your content.





 PROBLEM 
 Selecting and Styling the Second Child
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set the background color of the second <div> element to #8e44ad using the :nth-child pseudo-class.


SOLUTION
div:nth-child(2) {
    background-color:#8e44ad;
}






Pseudo-Element Selectors
Pseudo-elements let you style certain portions of text or add content before or after an 
element without modifying the HTML.

They are preceded by double colons (::).

Example

index.html
<p>This is an important message.</p>

style.css
/* Add content before a paragraph */
p::before {
    content: "Note: ";
    font-weight: bold;
    color: red;
}

/* Style the first letter of a paragraph */
p::first-letter {
    font-size: 2em;
    color: blue;
}


Pseudo-Element Selectors
Here, the text "Note: " is added before the paragraph, and the first letter of the paragraph 
is styled separately.







Tables


Introduction
Tables are a great way to organize and present data in a structured format. Let's look at an example:

index.html
<table>
    <caption>Table Caption</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Harry Depp</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>Britain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John Smith</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ram Krishna</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>Nepal</td>
    </tr>
</table>
Try running this code. The table appears, but it looks plain and unstructured.

HTML Table
Let's add some CSS properties to make it look better.





Table Borders
First, let's add a border to the table to give it a more defined structure.

You can use the border property for this task. For example:

index.html
<table>
    <caption>Table Caption</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Country</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Harry Depp</td>
        <td>28</td>
        <td>Britain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John Smith</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>USA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ram Krishna</td>
        <td>19</td>
        <td>Nepal</td>
    </tr>
</table>

style.css
table {
    border: 1px solid black;
}


HTML Table with Border
Now, the table has a black border, making it more structured. But you'll notice the rows
 and columns inside the table still lack borders.




 Adding Borders to Rows and Columns
To add borders to both the rows and columns, you need to apply the border to the table header 
(th) and table data (td) cells.

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
Now, the table has black borders around the cells, making the structure more defined.

HTML Table with Border and Cell Border
Figure: Adding Borders to Rows and Columns
However, the content looks cramped. Next, you'll remove this double border in the table to make 
the content less cramped and more readable.





Border Collapse
If you look closely, you can see a gap between the table borders in the previous example.

You can remove this gap by collapsing the borders using the border-collapse property.

Example

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-collapse: collapse; /* Collapses table borders */
}
Now the table looks much smoother.

HTML Table with Collapsed Border
Now, let's center the text inside each table cell both horizontally and vertically.









Table Alignment
Alignment is crucial for creating a reader-friendly table. Use the following properties to 
handle the alignment of the text inside your table:

text-align - Determines the horizontal alignment.
vertical-align - Determines the vertical alignment.
Example

index.html
style.css
table, th, td {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center; /* Centers text horizontally */
    vertical-align: middle; /* Centers text vertically */
    border-collapse: collapse; 
}
The texts inside the table cells are now aligned to the center—horizontally and vertically. 
The addition of 10px padding also enhances the neatness of the cells.

HTML Table with Center Alignment
However, you might not always want to align table content to the center. Don't worry; CSS has 
other alignment values as well.

Let's explore them next.






Table Alignment Values
The image below shows the different values you can use to align the content of your cells, 
along with how those values will place the text within the cell:

HTML Table Alignments
Figure: Some of the Possible Table Alignments
The first table shows examples of different text-align values applied to table cells (left, 
right, center, justify).

Similarly, the second table shows examples of different vertical-align values (top, middle, 
bottom, baseline).






Example: HTML Table Styling
We will create a table style with a modern touch that has striped rows and hover effects.

With just a few lines of CSS, you can transform a plain HTML table into something visually 
appealing and interactive.

index.html
<table class="striped-hover-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
         <th>Occupation</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>John Doe</td>
        <td>30</td>
        <td>Software Engineer</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>Jane Smith</td>
        <td>25</td>
        <td>Graphic Designer</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Sam Wilson</td>
        <td>35</td>
        <td>Project Manager</td>
    </tr>
</table>

style.css
.striped-hover-table {
    width: 100%;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

.striped-hover-table th, .striped-hover-table td {
    padding: 12px;
    text-align: left;
}

.striped-hover-table tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
}

.striped-hover-table tr:hover {
    background-color: #e9e9e9;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.striped-hover-table th {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: white;
    font-weight: bold;
}


HTML Table Styling
This example shows how CSS can make your tables look modern and engaging.

Now that you have a solid foundation for creating attractive tables, you can create virtually
 any design you can imagine.










LISTS 



Introduction
Lists help organize information in a sequential manner.

With CSS, you can style these lists to match the design of your webpage. In this lesson, 
you'll explore various list styles and customization options.

Let's look at an unstyled list:

index.html
<ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Ball</li>
    <li>Cat</li>
</ul>
If you run this code, a plain list will appear on the page.





Removing Bullets
First, let's start by removing the default bullets from a list. You can do this using
 the list-style-type property.

Example

index.html
style.css
ul.no-bullets {
    list-style-type: none;    /* Removes default bullets */
}


HTML List without Bullets
The list now has no bullets, giving it a clean, bullet-free appearance.





Customizing Bullet Types
Next, let's add custom bullets to the list. For example, you can use square bullets instead.

index.html
style.css
ul.square {
    list-style-type: square;    /* Adds square bullets */
}


HTML List with Square Bullets

Now, the list items have square bullets.





Example: List with Circle Bullets
You can also use other bullet styles like circle or disc.

Here's how you can do that:

index.html
style.css
ul.circle {
    list-style-type: circle;    /* Adds circle bullets */
}


HTML List with Circle Bullets
Now, the list items have circle bullets.

Replace the circle with a disc in the above code. The list will then have disc bullets.








Bullet Styling
Let's take a look at all possible values of the list-style-type property.

index.html
style.css
ul.no-bullets {
    list-style-type: none; /* Removes default bullets */
}

ul.square {
    list-style-type: square; /* Adds square bullets */
}

ul.circle {
    list-style-type: circle; /* Adds circle bullets */
}

ul.disc {
    list-style-type: disc; /* Adds disc bullets */
}
The list now has customized bullets, allowing for different visual styles.



HTML List with Mixed Bullets

Now that you know how to style your lists, let's explore how you can control the position of 
the bullets or numbers with the list-style-position property.






List Style Position
The list-style-position property controls whether the marker (bullet) is placed inside or outside 
the content flow of the list item.

For example:

index.html
style.css
ul.inside {
    list-style-position: inside;
}
Looking at the output, you can see that the bullet of the first list starts at the same position 
as the first letter of the items of the second list.







Example: Stylish Lists with CSS
CSS allows you to create visually engaging lists that can enhance the presentation of your content.

index.html
style.css
* {
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
background-color: #f8f9fa;
text-align: center;
}

.list-container {
background-color: #fff;
border-radius: 8px;
padding: 20px;
width: 300px;
margin: 30px auto;
}

h2 {
color: #333;
margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.styled-list {
list-style-type: none;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
}

.styled-list li {
background-color: #3498db;
color: white;
padding: 10px;
margin: 10px 0;
border-radius: 5px;
font-size: 18px;
text-align: left;
}

.styled-list li .icon {
left: 10px;
font-size: 20px;
}

.styled-list li:hover {
background-color: #2980b9;
}
Browser Output

List Styling CSS

This example shows how to create a stylish list layout using only CSS properties for text and 
background styling.








Problem 

Style List
Style the given unordered HTML list as follows:

Make the bullet points square-shaped.
Set the list items' text color to #ff5733 (orange).
Add 10px padding to the left of each list item.


Solution
ul {
    list-style-type: square; /* Adds square bullets */
}
li {
    color:#ff5733;
    padding-left:10px;
}








link



Links (Anchor Tags <a>)
Links allow users to navigate from one page to another. You can style these links to change their 
appearance based on how the user interacts with them.

Let's look at how to change the color of a link in different states: normal, visited, hovered, 
and active.

Use pseudo-classes such as visited, hover, and active to apply CSS to different states.

Example

index.html
<a href="https://programiz.pro" target="_blank">Welcome to Programiz Pro</a>


style.css
/* Normal state:
 how the link looks when 
it's not clicked */
a {
    color: blue;
}

/* Visited state: 
how the link looks after the user 
has visited it */
a:visited {
    color: purple;
}

/* Hover state: 
how the link looks when the user 
hovers their mouse over it */
a:hover {
    color: red;
}

/* Active state: 
how the link looks when the 
user clicks and holds the mouse button */
a:active {
    color: green;
}
Hit run code and try it out.

The link will change colors as you interact with it:

You can see the link in its default blue state.
When you hover over it, notice how the color changes to red.
As you click and hold the link, it turns green, indicating the active state.
Once you visit the link and return to this page, you'll see it's purple, showing that you've 
already visited it.









Important Note about CSS Order
The order of CSS rules for link states matters. If you place :visited last, 
it will override any :hover or :active styles you set for links that have been
visited, meaning :hover and :active effects won't show up on links you've clicked on before.

Here's an easy rule to follow:

Always write your CSS rules in this order for links: :link, :visited, :hover, :active.
This way, :hover and :active will work correctly for all links—even after they've been clicked on.






Example: Styling a Navigation Bar (Navbar)
With CSS, you can transform a simple list of links into an appealing and functional 
navigation bar (navbar).

The following example demonstrates how to use CSS to make a list of links function as 
a navigation bar.

index.html
<nav class="navbar">
    <div class="nav-left">
        <a href="#">Jane</a>
    </div>
    <ul class="nav-right">
        <li><a href="#">Projects</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.navbar {
    background-color: #2c2c52;
    padding: 0 20px;
    height: 50px;
    line-height: 50px;
}

.nav-left {
    float: left;
}

.nav-left a {
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 30px;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Right-aligned list */
.nav-right {
    float: right;
    list-style: none;
}

.nav-right li {
    display: inline;
    margin-left: 20px;
}

.nav-right a {
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover{
 color: #c0c0c0;
}


Navbar Styling CSS
You can enhance the navbar further with additional styles or responsive design techniques 
to fit various devices and screen sizes.










FORMS

Introduction
In this lesson, you'll use CSS to build a styled contact form one step at a time.

By the end, you'll have a fully functional and well-designed contact form for your portfolio.

Let's get started.



Adding HTML
Let's start by writing the basic HTML structure for the contact form. This will include 
input fields such as text, email, dropdowns, and a submit button.

Additionally, we'll add a browser reset to remove any default styling and provide a clean 
foundation for custom CSS.

index.html
<form class="contact-form">
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="fullname">Full Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="fullname" name="fullname" placeholder="Your Full Name" required>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="email">Email Address</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" required>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="subject">Subject</label>
        <input type="text" id="subject" name="subject" placeholder="Subject of your message" required>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="reason">Reason for Contact</label>
        <select id="reason" name="reason" required>
            <option value="" disabled selected>Select a reason</option>
            <option value="networking">Networking</option>
            <option value="freelance">Freelance</option>
            <option value="support">Support</option>
            <option value="feedback">Feedback</option>
            <option value="other">Other</option>
        </select>
    </div>

    <div class="form-group">
        <label for="message">Message</label>
        <textarea id="message" name="message" placeholder="Your message..." rows="5" required></textarea>
    </div>

    <button type="submit" class="submit-btn">Send Message</button>
</form>

style.css
/* Basic reset */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}









Styling the Form
Now that we have the HTML, we can begin styling the form. The wrapper ensures the form is 
visually separated from other elements on the page, giving it a distinct look.

We'll start by giving the form a background color, some padding, and centered text.

index.html
style.css
/* Form background styling */
.contact-form {
    background-color: #ccc;
    padding: 40px;
    text-align: center;
}

.contact-form h2 {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    color: #333;
    font-size: 24px;
}



Styling Form Groups
Next, we'll style the individual form groups. Each group contains a label and an input
 field (or select/textarea).

By adding space between the elements and aligning the text correctly, we can ensure that the
 form is easy to read and visually appealing.

index.html
style.css
/* Form group styling */
.form-group {
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    text-align: left;
}

.form-group label {
    font-size: 14px;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    display: block;
    color: #333;
    font-weight: bold;
}

.form-group input,
.form-group textarea,
.form-group select {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    font-size: 14px;
    background-color: #fafafa;
    color: #333;
}




Styling the Submit Button
Finally, we'll style the submit button. The button should be clearly visible and inviting 
for users to click.

We'll use a distinct background color (#3498db) and add a hover effect to make the button
 interactive and provide visual feedback when hovered over.

index.html
style.css
/* Button styling */
.submit-btn {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 12px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    width: 100%;
}

.submit-btn:hover {
    background-color: #2980b9;
}









Review
In this chapter:

You learned how to style tables using CSS by adding borders, padding, aligning text, and 
adding captions.
You explored different ways to customize lists by changing or removing bullet types.
You styled links to change colors based on user interaction.
You styled different form elements individually.
In the next chapter, you'll dive into advanced CSS techniques. You'll learn about flexbox, 
which will allow you to create complex and responsive designs.
