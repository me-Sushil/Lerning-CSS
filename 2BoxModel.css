Introduction
In this chapter, you will learn about the box model—an essential concept for sizing, spacing, 
and positioning elements on a webpage.

First, let's understand the box model. Then, you'll learn about its components.


1. Box Model Basic

Every Element is a Box
Every HTML element on a webpage is treated as a rectangular box. You can easily observe this
 by adding a background to the elements in your code.

index.html
style.css
div {
    background: #cccccc;
}

h3 {
    background: #32a881;
}

span {
    background: #7e82a6;
}

As you can see, every HTML element (like <div>, <h3>, and <span>) forms a rectangular box.

By controlling the size and space within and between these boxes, you can build a complex layout. 
The box model helps you do exactly that.



Parts of a Box
The box model consists of four main components:

Content
Border
Padding
Margin
Let's start by looking at the content component of the box.



Example 1: Box Model
Consider a simple element:

Box Model Example
Figure: BoxModel.png
The card you see above is a box.

The text and images inside it are its content. Content are the elements that you interact 
with directly.

Border, padding, and margin are the components outside content. You'll learn about them 
individually in the upcoming lessons.

Let's look at another example.




> ## Border
The border is the boundary line that surrounds the content of an element.

You can style it using the border property:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px solid #ff0000;
}

Simple Border
Now, our button has a 4px thick, solid border of the color #ff0000 on all four sides.

Note: You can also individually style each side of a border using the border-top, border-right,
border-bottom, and border-left properties.
Let's learn how to change the width, style, and color of a border.





Border Width
The border property syntax is:

border: width style color;
The first value here specifies the thickness of the border.

Example

index.html
<h1>Sneakers on Sale</h1>
<p>Step up your game with these trendy, ultra-comfortable sneakers designed for both performance and style. Perfect for casual wear or a workout!</p>
<a href="#">Buy Now</a>

style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 2px solid #ff0000;
}

Now, the button has a border of 2px width.





Border Style
The second value in border property syntax specifies the style of the border.

It can have the following possible values:

Border Style	Description
solid	A single solid line.
dashed	A series of dashes.
dotted	A series of dots.
none	No border.
Example

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px dashed #ff0000;
}


Now, the button has a dashed border.



Border Color
The third value in the border property specifies the border color.

You can use the color name, hex code, or rgb value to define the border color.

For example:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);
}


Now, the button has a red colored border.





Border Radius
You can also use the border-radius property to create rounded corners on elements.

Example

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    border: 4px solid #ff0000;

    border-radius: 50px;
}


Border Radius
The button now has rounded corners.

You can also create shapes like a perfect circle using this property. Let's explore this next.



Problem 
Border Width and Radius
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set width and height of <div> to 200px.
Make the border solid, 10px wide and green in color.
Fully round the corners to create a circle.


solution 
div {
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    border: 10px solid green;
    border-radius:50%;
}







> ## Padding


Padding is the space between the content of an element and its border.

Let's use the padding property to pad 'Buy Now' button on all four sides:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies a padding of 10px */
    padding: 10px;
}

Padding
Here, padding of 10px is added on all sides between the content and border of the <a> element.


Problem 
Adding Padding and Background Color
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set the padding of all sides to 20px.
Set the background color to #8e44ad.

solution
div {
    background-color:#8e44ad;
    padding:20px;
}



Providing Two Values
Providing one value to padding sets equal padding on all sides.

Providing two values sets different values for vertical and horizontal padding:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px vertical and 30px horizontal padding  */
    padding: 10px 30px;
}


Padding Using Two Values
Here, padding of 10px is applied to the top and bottom and padding of 30px is applied to the sides.


Note: The syntax for providing two padding values is padding: vertical horizontal;.



Providing Three Values
Three values for padding apply to top, horizontal (left and right), and bottom:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px padding on top, 
    30px on the sides and 
    20px on the bottom  */
    padding: 10px 30px 20px;
}



Providing Four Values
Four values for padding apply to top, right, bottom, and left in clockwise order:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px on top, 
    30px on right, 
    40px on bottom, and 
    50px on left */
    padding: 10px 30px 40px 50px;
}


Padding Using Four Values

Note: You can also provide the individual values
 using padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-right, and padding-left properties.



> ## Margin


While padding adds space inside the border, margin adds space outside the border, separating 
one element from another.

Idea Emoji
Note: Margins don't change an element's actual size—they only create space between elements.
 This makes margins ideal for spacing without altering layout dimensions.
Horizontal margins, like padding, work on all elements. However, vertical margins (top and bottom)
 only apply to block elements. To add a vertical margin to an inline element, like a link, you'll 
 need to change its display type to block.

For example:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 10px;
    
    /* Makes it a block element with width 70px */
    display: block;
    width: 70px;

    /* Applies 30px margin on all sides */
    margin: 30px;
}


Margin
Note: Just like with padding, you can control the margin on individual sides using margin-top,
 margin-bottom, margin-left, and margin-right properties.




 inline-block
We've seen that inline elements (like text links) can't have vertical margins, and block elements
 can.

But what if you want something in between? For example, consider you're building a navigation menu.
 You want the links on the menu on the same line, but also separated by a margin.

That's where the inline-block comes in.

With inline-block, you get the best of both:

Inline behavior: Elements stay on the same line.
Block behavior: You can control the element's width and height, and yes—add vertical margins.
Let's explore this with an example:

index.html
style.css
nav li {
    background-color: pink;
    
    display: inline-block;

    /* Accepts block behavior while remaining inline */
    width: 150px;
    height: 50px;
    margin: 10px; 
}
With this covered, let's get back to margins.

Think of inline-block as a hybrid or a "best of both worlds" setting. To understand it easily, 
let's look at the two things it’s combining:

1. The "Inline" Part (The Social Side)
Inline elements are like words in a sentence. They are happy to sit right next to each other on the
same line.
The problem: 
You can't tell a word in a sentence to be "50px tall" or have a "20px gap above it." 
It just ignores you because it's focused on staying in line.

2. The "Block" Part (The Bossy Side)
Block elements are like bricks. They are heavy and always start on a new line, pushing everything 
else away.
The problem: 
You can't put two bricks side-by-side easily because they always want their own dedicated row. 
But, they do listen when you tell them how wide or tall to be.

3. The "Inline-Block" (The Hybrid)
When you use display: inline-block, you create an element that is polite enough to stay on the 
same line (like a word), but strong enough to have a width, height, and margins (like a brick).

Why use it for a Navigation Menu?
Imagine you have 5 menu links (Home, About, Contact, etc.).
- If they are Block: They will stack on top of each other like a list. (Not what you want for a top bar).
- If they are Inline: They will stay side-by-side, but they will look squashed because you can't 
add height or top/bottom spacing to make them look like clickable buttons.
- If they are Inline-Block: They stay side-by-side AND you can make them look like big, spaced-out buttons.

Feature                    Inline       Block        Inline-Block 
Stays on one line?          Yes          No           Yes 
Respects Width/Height?       No          Yes          Yes
Respects Vertical Margins?   No          Yes          Yes











Auto Margins
By setting margin to auto, you can center an element horizontally in CSS.

For example,

index.html
style.css
a {
     padding-top: 10px;
    display: block;
    width: 120px;
    height: 30px;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #2596be;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

   /* Center element horizontally */
    margin: auto;
}


Auto Margins
margin: auto; centers an element horizontally within its parent element (here, the <body>).


Note: You can achieve the same effect by individually setting margin-left and margin-right to auto.







Vertical Margin Collapse
In the code below, two <div> elements are arranged vertically. Each has a margin of 50px. 
What do you think is the gap between them?

Run the code below to check your answer:

index.html
style.css
div {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: white;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;

    /* Applies 50px margin to both divs */
    margin: 50px;
}

Vertical Margin Collapse
Did you guess 100px? It's actually just 50px.

This is because of a CSS behavior, called vertical margin collapse. When two elements with 
margins between them are vertically stacked, their margin values are collapsed. Only the larger 
value among them is applied between—here, 50px.

Note: This only happens with vertical margins (top and bottom). Horizontal margins (left and right)
do not collapse.






Control Vertical Spacing
That's why, when increasing or decreasing the space between vertically placed block-level elements, 
make sure you only use one margin:

Either the bottom margin of the first element.
Or the top margin of the second element.



Box Sizing
By default, padding and borders are not included in an element's width and height.

This means if you set a width of 300px and add padding or borders, the actual size will be 
larger than 300px.




Box Sizing
The box-sizing property lets you control this behavior.

Setting box-sizing: border-box; ensures that padding and borders are included in the 
element's width and height, keeping the size exactly as you defined.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: #add8e6;
    border: 50px solid black;
    padding: 50px;

    /* Specify border-box */
    box-sizing: border-box;
}


Box Sizing: border-box
Note: The default value for box-sizing is content-box. Padding and borders are excluded 
when using this value.




Problem 

Complex Box Model
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set a margin of 20px on all sides.
Apply a 5px solid #34495e border.
Add padding of 50px to all sides.
Set the width to 150px and height to 150px.
Apply a background color of #9b59b6.
Make sure the <div> is circular in shape.


Solution 

div {
    background-color:#9b59b6;
    height:150px;
    width:150px;
    border: 5px solid #34495e;
    border-radius:50%;
    margin:20px;
    padding: 50px;
}





Height, Width, and Auto Sizing
Before we move on to the next topic, let's quickly recap the height and width properties.

These properties let you control how tall and wide an element is on a web page.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: #add8e6;
}
The code above creates a box that's 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.

However, setting exact values isn't always practical—for example, content length of 
user-generated comments on a website is unpredictable.

In such cases, auto value comes in handy.

You can set height: auto; to adjust the height of the comment box automatically. This 
grows and shrinks the size of the box accordingly to fit the content inside.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
    background-color: #add8e6;
}
Try adding more content to <div>. You'll notice its width will remain 300 pixels, but its 
height will grow naturally to fit the content.

Imagine we hadn't used auto height, what would happen if the content was too big for the box?






Overflow
Suppose you've set exact values for height and width of and element, but the content inside
 exceeds it.

In such a case, the content overflows, making the layout look messy.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    /* Specifying small height */
    height: 140px;

    background-color: #0cd1ba;
    border: 2px solid black;
}


Overflowing Content
As you can see, the content overflows the container element.

You can manage cases like this using the overflow property. Let's explore this further.








Overflow: Hidden
overflow: hidden; simply clips the overflowing content from the container.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    height: 140px;
    background-color: #0cd1ba;
    border: 2px solid #000000;

    /* Hide overflowing content */
    overflow: hidden;
}


Hidden Scrollbar
Here, the overflowing content is hidden and can't be accessed.

Now, let's look at another way you can manage overflowing content.

Note: You can also control overflow behavior horizontally or vertically using overflow-x and overflow-y.






Overflow: Auto
overflow: auto hides the overflowing content, but it can be accessed by scrolling the container.

Example

index.html
style.css
div {
    height: 140px;
    background-color: #0cd1ba;
    border: 2px solid #000000;

    /* Make overflowing content scrollable */
    overflow: auto;
}


Auto Scrollbar

Note: The auto value generates scrollbars only when the content overflows. If you want the 
scrollbars regardless of the overflow, use the scroll value.










Introduction
Great job! You've successfully learned the basics of the CSS box model, including how to 
control the size, spacing, and layout of HTML elements.

Before you start your project, it's time to learn two essential CSS concepts (class 
selectors and universal selectors) that will help you organize and style your webpage 
even more efficiently.









Class Selectors
Often, you'll want to apply the same style to multiple elements on your page. Instead of 
repeating the CSS for each element, you can use a class selector.

A class selector applies the same CSS to all elements having the specified class.

It is specified using a period (.) followed by the class name.

Example

index.html
<h2>Section First</h2>
<p class="orange-bg">This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>

<h2>Section Second</h2>
<p class="orange-bg">This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>


style.css
.orange-bg {
    background-color: orange;
}


Class Selectors
The class selector .orange-bg selects all HTML elements with the orange-bg class name and 
styles their background-color to orange.





Using Class Selectors with Element Tag Names
You can combine class selectors with element tag names, allowing you to target only 
specific types of elements with a particular class.

Example

index.html
<h2 class="highlighted">This heading will not be styled.</h2>
<p class="highlighted">This paragraph will be styled.</p>
<div class="highlighted">This div will also not be styled.</div>

style.css
p.highlighted {
    color: blue;
}
Here, the class selector p.highlighted will only apply the blue color to the <p> elements 
with the highlighted class.

Other elements like <h2> and <div> that also have the highlighted class will not be affected 
by this rule.




Multiple Classes on One Element
An element can have multiple classes.

This is particularly useful for applying different styles to a single element.

Example

index.html
<p class="highlighted bordered">This paragraph has multiple styles.</p>

style.css
/* Applies yellow background color */
.highlighted {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* Applies border */
.bordered {
    border: 2px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
}
Here, the paragraph element has both highlighted and bordered classes.







Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML element on the webpage at once.

Example

index.html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>First Paragraph</p>
<p>Second Paragraph</p>

style.css
/* Selects and styles all HTML elements at once */
* {
    color: red;
}




Resetting Default Styles with the Universal Selector
Browsers have default styles that can affect your design. To start with a clean slate, use 
the universal selector to reset these styles.

Here are two basic styling resets you'll use frequently:

1. Resetting Margin and Padding

Browsers add margin and padding on all elements by default. You can remove them by setting 
margin: 0; and padding: 0;.

2. Box-Sizing Reset

Setting box-sizing: border-box; ensures that the padding and border are included in the 
width and height of elements, avoiding unexpected spacing issues.

Here's the combined CSS reset:

* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
With these two selectors—class selectors and the universal selector—you're now equipped to 
start working on your project.

Let's dive into the project and put the concepts learned in this chapter into practice!








Project Introduction: What You Will Learn
In this project, you'll build a simple card layout to display course information, similar 
to the design in the Programiz PRO website.

What You Will Learn
Figure: Project Introduction: What You Will Learn
You'll apply the CSS box model, work on some text styling, and use layout techniques you've
 already learned as you go along.

You'll also discover some new properties that will prepare you to create more complex 
layouts in the future.



Step 1: Set Up the Container
Let's start by setting up the main container to hold all the course information.

First, you'll create an HTML structure using a <div> element as the main container.
Then, you'll add a section title using an <h2> element to help describe the section.
Inside the main container, you'll add two <div> elements. Each one will represent an individual
 course.
Here's the corresponding HTML:

index.html
<div class="courses-container">
    <h2>Courses similar to this</h2>

    <div>
        <h3>Learn JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>8 Chapters • 149+ Questions</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Learn JavaScript Intermediate</h3>
        <p>5 Chapters • 34 Questions</p>
    </div>
</div>




Step 2: Reset Browser Styles
Before adding your own custom styles, it's a good idea to reset the default browser styles. This helps ensure that all elements look the same across different browsers—so you won't have any unexpected issues.

Let's add the following CSS to reset the margins, padding, and box-sizing for all the elements on the page:

index.html
style.css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
This clears any default spacing so that you can start fresh!




Step 3: Style the Container
Now that you've set up the structure, let's add some styles to the container to make
 it more visually appealing:

Add padding to the container so there's some space around the content.
Choose a background color (#fff5e7) to make the container stand out.
Pick a font for the text to keep the design consistent and easy to read.
Here's the CSS you can use to style the container:

index.html
style.css
.courses-container {
    background-color: #fff5e7;
    padding: 32px; 
    font-family: "Euclid Circular A", sans-serif;
}

Note: The lesson only shows the relevant code for each step, but the editor has all 
the code together so you can see everything you've done so far. This will also be the case for future projects.
This gives the container a light background and some spacing around the edges.




Step 4: Add and Style the Course Cards
Now, let's make each of those course sections look like cards.

Next steps:

Add a class to each <div> that represents a course. Let's call it course-card.
Then, you'll style the cards with padding, margins, and a white background to make them stand out.
Here's how to update the HTML:

index.html
style.css
<div class="courses-container">
    <h2>Courses similar to this</h2>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3>Learn JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>8 Chapters • 149+ Questions</p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3>Learn JavaScript Intermediate</h3>
        <p>5 Chapters • 34 Questions</p>
    </div>
</div>
And here's the CSS to style the cards:

index.html
style.css
.course-card {
    background-color: #fff;  
    padding: 32px 16px;    
    margin: 16px;    
    border-radius: 8px;    
    display: inline-block;    
    text-align: center;   
    border: 1px solid #ddd;    
    width: 240px;
}
Now, the course cards have a clean look with a white background and rounded corners.






Step 5: Style the Text
Let's make the titles of the section and course cards stand out more.

Next steps:

Add a class for the section title (<h2>) called courses-title.
Style the course titles (<h3>) to add weight and color.
Update the HTML and add this CSS to style the titles:

index.html
<div class="courses-container">
    <h2 class="courses-title">Courses similar to this</h2>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3 class="course-title">Learn JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <p>8 Chapters • 149+ Questions</p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3 class="course-title">Learn JavaScript Intermediate</h3>
        <p>5 Chapters • 34 Questions</p>
    </div>
</div>

style.css
/* Section title styles */
.courses-title {
    color: #25265e;
    font-size: 24px;
    margin-bottom: 16px;
}

/* Course title styles */
.course-title {
    font-size: 18px;
    color: #25265e;
    margin-bottom: 12px;
    text-align: left;
    font-weight: bold;
}
Now, the titles are larger and more eye-catching.



Step 6: Add and Style Images
Finally, add images to each course card to make them more visually appealing.

Next steps:

Add an <img> tag to each course card with the src and alt attributes for the image.
Style the images to make them fit inside the cards.
Here's the updated HTML and CSS with images:

index.html
<div class="courses-container">
    <h2 class="courses-title">Courses similar to this</h2>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3 class="course-title">Learn JavaScript Basics</h3>
        <img src="/images/learn-css/learn-js-basics.png" alt="JavaScript Basics Logo" class="course-image">
        <p>8 Chapters • 149+ Questions</p>
    </div>

    <div class="course-card">
        <h3 class="course-title">Learn JavaScript Intermediate</h3>
        <img src="/images/learn-css/learn-js-intermediate.png" alt="JavaScript Intermediate Logo" class="course-image">
        <p>5 Chapters • 34 Questions</p>
    </div>
</div>

style.css
/* Course image styles */
.course-image {
    width: 160px;      /* Set image width */
    height: auto;      /* Maintain aspect ratio */
    margin-bottom: 16px;
}
Now, the course cards include images that make them much more engaging.





Final Project: Complete Code
Here's the complete code for your project:

index.html
<div class="courses-container">
    <h2 class="courses-title">Courses similar to this</h2>
