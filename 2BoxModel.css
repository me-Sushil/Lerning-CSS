Introduction
In this chapter, you will learn about the box model—an essential concept for sizing, spacing, 
and positioning elements on a webpage.

First, let's understand the box model. Then, you'll learn about its components.


1. Box Model Basic

Every Element is a Box
Every HTML element on a webpage is treated as a rectangular box. You can easily observe this
 by adding a background to the elements in your code.

index.html
style.css
div {
    background: #cccccc;
}

h3 {
    background: #32a881;
}

span {
    background: #7e82a6;
}

As you can see, every HTML element (like <div>, <h3>, and <span>) forms a rectangular box.

By controlling the size and space within and between these boxes, you can build a complex layout. 
The box model helps you do exactly that.



Parts of a Box
The box model consists of four main components:

Content
Border
Padding
Margin
Let's start by looking at the content component of the box.



Example 1: Box Model
Consider a simple element:

Box Model Example
Figure: BoxModel.png
The card you see above is a box.

The text and images inside it are its content. Content are the elements that you interact 
with directly.

Border, padding, and margin are the components outside content. You'll learn about them 
individually in the upcoming lessons.

Let's look at another example.




> ## Border
The border is the boundary line that surrounds the content of an element.

You can style it using the border property:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px solid #ff0000;
}

Simple Border
Now, our button has a 4px thick, solid border of the color #ff0000 on all four sides.

Note: You can also individually style each side of a border using the border-top, border-right,
border-bottom, and border-left properties.
Let's learn how to change the width, style, and color of a border.





Border Width
The border property syntax is:

border: width style color;
The first value here specifies the thickness of the border.

Example

index.html
<h1>Sneakers on Sale</h1>
<p>Step up your game with these trendy, ultra-comfortable sneakers designed for both performance and style. Perfect for casual wear or a workout!</p>
<a href="#">Buy Now</a>

style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 2px solid #ff0000;
}

Now, the button has a border of 2px width.





Border Style
The second value in border property syntax specifies the style of the border.

It can have the following possible values:

Border Style	Description
solid	A single solid line.
dashed	A series of dashes.
dotted	A series of dots.
none	No border.
Example

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px dashed #ff0000;
}


Now, the button has a dashed border.



Border Color
The third value in the border property specifies the border color.

You can use the color name, hex code, or rgb value to define the border color.

For example:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;

    /* Border styling */
    border: 4px solid rgb(255, 0, 0);
}


Now, the button has a red colored border.





Border Radius
You can also use the border-radius property to create rounded corners on elements.

Example

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    border: 4px solid #ff0000;

    border-radius: 50px;
}


Border Radius
The button now has rounded corners.

You can also create shapes like a perfect circle using this property. Let's explore this next.



Problem 
Border Width and Radius
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set width and height of <div> to 200px.
Make the border solid, 10px wide and green in color.
Fully round the corners to create a circle.


solution 
div {
    width:200px;
    height:200px;
    border: 10px solid green;
    border-radius:50%;
}







> ## Padding


Padding is the space between the content of an element and its border.

Let's use the padding property to pad 'Buy Now' button on all four sides:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies a padding of 10px */
    padding: 10px;
}

Padding
Here, padding of 10px is added on all sides between the content and border of the <a> element.


Problem 
Adding Padding and Background Color
Can you style the given webpage as follows?

Set the padding of all sides to 20px.
Set the background color to #8e44ad.

solution
div {
    background-color:#8e44ad;
    padding:20px;
}



Providing Two Values
Providing one value to padding sets equal padding on all sides.

Providing two values sets different values for vertical and horizontal padding:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px vertical and 30px horizontal padding  */
    padding: 10px 30px;
}


Padding Using Two Values
Here, padding of 10px is applied to the top and bottom and padding of 30px is applied to the sides.


Note: The syntax for providing two padding values is padding: vertical horizontal;.



Providing Three Values
Three values for padding apply to top, horizontal (left and right), and bottom:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px padding on top, 
    30px on the sides and 
    20px on the bottom  */
    padding: 10px 30px 20px;
}



Providing Four Values
Four values for padding apply to top, right, bottom, and left in clockwise order:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    
    /* Applies 10px on top, 
    30px on right, 
    40px on bottom, and 
    50px on left */
    padding: 10px 30px 40px 50px;
}


Padding Using Four Values

Note: You can also provide the individual values
 using padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-right, and padding-left properties.



> ## Margin


While padding adds space inside the border, margin adds space outside the border, separating 
one element from another.

Idea Emoji
Note: Margins don't change an element's actual size—they only create space between elements.
 This makes margins ideal for spacing without altering layout dimensions.
Horizontal margins, like padding, work on all elements. However, vertical margins (top and bottom)
 only apply to block elements. To add a vertical margin to an inline element, like a link, you'll 
 need to change its display type to block.

For example:

index.html
style.css
a {
    background-color: #6603fc;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 10px;
    
    /* Makes it a block element with width 70px */
    display: block;
    width: 70px;

    /* Applies 30px margin on all sides */
    margin: 30px;
}


Margin
Note: Just like with padding, you can control the margin on individual sides using margin-top,
 margin-bottom, margin-left, and margin-right properties.




 inline-block
We've seen that inline elements (like text links) can't have vertical margins, and block elements
 can.

But what if you want something in between? For example, consider you're building a navigation menu.
 You want the links on the menu on the same line, but also separated by a margin.

That's where the inline-block comes in.

With inline-block, you get the best of both:

Inline behavior: Elements stay on the same line.
Block behavior: You can control the element's width and height, and yes—add vertical margins.
Let's explore this with an example:

index.html
style.css
nav li {
    background-color: pink;
    
    display: inline-block;

    /* Accepts block behavior while remaining inline */
    width: 150px;
    height: 50px;
    margin: 10px; 
}
With this covered, let's get back to margins.

Think of inline-block as a hybrid or a "best of both worlds" setting. To understand it easily, 
let's look at the two things it’s combining:

1. The "Inline" Part (The Social Side)
Inline elements are like words in a sentence. They are happy to sit right next to each other on the
same line.
The problem: 
You can't tell a word in a sentence to be "50px tall" or have a "20px gap above it." 
It just ignores you because it's focused on staying in line.

2. The "Block" Part (The Bossy Side)
Block elements are like bricks. They are heavy and always start on a new line, pushing everything 
else away.
The problem: 
You can't put two bricks side-by-side easily because they always want their own dedicated row. 
But, they do listen when you tell them how wide or tall to be.

3. The "Inline-Block" (The Hybrid)
When you use display: inline-block, you create an element that is polite enough to stay on the 
same line (like a word), but strong enough to have a width, height, and margins (like a brick).

Why use it for a Navigation Menu?
Imagine you have 5 menu links (Home, About, Contact, etc.).
- If they are Block: They will stack on top of each other like a list. (Not what you want for a top bar).
- If they are Inline: They will stay side-by-side, but they will look squashed because you can't 
add height or top/bottom spacing to make them look like clickable buttons.
- If they are Inline-Block: They stay side-by-side AND you can make them look like big, spaced-out buttons.

Feature                    Inline       Block        Inline-Block 
Stays on one line?          Yes          No           Yes 
Respects Width/Height?       No          Yes          Yes
Respects Vertical Margins?   No          Yes          Yes
