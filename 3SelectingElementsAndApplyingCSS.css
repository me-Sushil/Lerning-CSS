LINKING CSS WITH HTML


Introduction

In this chapter, you'll learn how HTML and CSS work together, including the 
different ways to write CSS.

You'll also learn different selectors besides the element and class selectors you learned 
in the previous chapters.



HTML and CSS are Linked
You have been using our code editor, which includes two tabs—index.html for HTML and 
style.css for CSS—until now.

Tabs for Editor
Figure: Tabs for Editor
Notice how the two files work together; the CSS code you write automatically styles the
 HTML elements. That's because our code editor automatically links style.css with index.html.

However, when building real-world projects, you need to manually link CSS with HTML for them to work.

Let's learn how to do that on the next page.




Linking CSS with HTML
You can link a .css file with a .html file using the <link> tag. Simply put it in the <head> 
tag of the HTML document as follows:

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
All the styling rules you write in style.css will be applied to the HTML document.

This way of linking a CSS file with HTML is also known as external linking.

Let's see why external linking is so great.



Linking Multiple CSS Files
When working on real-world projects, your CSS code can get long. In such cases, you may need to 
organize your code in multiple files.

That's when external linking comes in handy, as you can link multiple CSS files to an HTML document.

Here's what linking multiple CSS files may look like:

<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style2.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style3.css">
</head>
This way, all the styling rules in style1.css, style2.css, and style3.css will be applied to the 
HTML document.

Now, let's see the other ways of writing CSS.





Internal CSS
Instead of creating a separate file, you can directly write CSS in the same HTML file using
 the <style> tag. For example:

index.html
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: orange;
            font-size: 24px;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Oranges are a great source of vitamin C!
    </p>
</body>
Run the above code to see how internal CSS works.


Note: Internal CSS is primarily useful when trying small code snippets. Using internal 
CSS in real-world projects can make it challenging to organize the project.






Inline CSS
Using inline CSS, you can apply styles directly to individual HTML elements. You use the 
style attribute to add inline CSS.

For example:

index.html
<p style="color: orange; font-size: 24px;">Oranges are a great source of vitamin C!</p>
Here, style="color: orange; font-size: 24px;" directly styles the text by setting its color
 to orange and font size to 24px.

Although using inline CSS might seem like an easy option since it doesn't require selectors,
 it's generally considered bad practice.

Inline styles can clutter your HTML, make your code harder to maintain, and reduce reusability.

It's generally better to keep your styles separate using external CSS.



SELECTORS AND COMBINETORS


Introduction
Now that you've linked your CSS file to your HTML, it's time to learn how to select specific
HTML elements for styling.

CSS selectors allow you to target and style specific elements in various ways.

So far, you have learned about three selectors:

Element Selectors
Class Selectors
Universal Selectors
Let's do a quick recap.




Revision: Selectors
Element Selectors

The element selector applies styles to all HTML elements of a given type (e.g., <h1>, <p>).

For example, h1 { color: red; } will style all <h1> elements with red text.

Class Selectors

Class selectors apply styles to elements with a specific class attribute.

For example, .first-paragraph { background-color: orange; } will style all elements with the
 class first-paragraph.

Universal Selector

The universal selector (*) targets all HTML elements.

For example, * { color: red; } applies the red text color to every element.

It's mostly used to reset default styles, such as setting margin: 0 and padding: 0, to ensure 
consistency across browsers.






ID Selectors
Now, let's learn about our final selector: the ID selector.

Sometimes, you may want to style only a specific, unique part of a webpage, such as a 
header or footer. To achieve this, you can use the ID selector.

The ID selector targets a single HTML element with a unique identifier (ID) and applies
 specific styles to it.

In CSS, the ID selector is specified using the hash (#) character, followed by the id 
of the HTML element.

Let's see an example.

index.html
<header id="main-header">
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</header>

<main id = "main-content">
    <p>Your webpage body goes here.</p>
</main>

<footer id="main-footer">
    <p>© 2024 My Website</p>
</footer>

style.css
/* Reset browser defaults */
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Styles for the header */
#main-header {
    background-color: #3a506b;
    color: #f4d35e;
    padding: 40px;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
    border-bottom: 3px solid #5bc0be;
}

/* Styles for the main content */
#main-content {
    height: 400px;
    background: #c0c0c0;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Styles for the footer */
#main-footer {
    background-color: #1c2541;
    color: #edf2f4;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: right;
    font-size: 16px;
    border-top: 2px solid #f4d35e;
}


ID Selectors
In this example, the ID selector #main-header applies styles only to the unique <header> 
element with the id="main-header".

Similarly, the #main-footer selector targets the unique <footer> element with the id="main-footer".

Even though you might have multiple sections or paragraphs in the document, only the unique 
header and footer are affected by these ID-specific styles.


Note: Like class selectors, you can also target elements using ID selectors with the element's
 tag name. For example, instead of just #my-id, you can write div#my-id.
